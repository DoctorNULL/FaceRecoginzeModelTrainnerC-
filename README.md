# Problem
recoginze each person in front of a camera by making the computer identitfy this person through taking some images for him
to use it in any other application such as face identification , submit attendance and security elements like identifying people entering some place

# Solution
1. Get a computer with attached camera ready (**Recommended** : *high quality camera*)
2. Using OpenCV liberary create a dataset for the person required to be known
3. Repet step 2 until we get all required persons
4. Train a model using LBPH Face Recognizer in OpenCV face module
5. Open the camera again in the identification state to identify anyone in front of it

# Steps
1. Download OpenCV 4.4.0 from https://opencv.org/
2. Install the required OpenCV dll files into windows system directry by using cmake on OpenCV files
3. Download the program from http://www.mediafire.com/file/jctgdoyrlfluf9k/FaceRecoginizer.rar/file
4. Extract the downloaded file
5. Run the exe file
6. Press 1 to create dataset
7. Talk 20 Pictures for the person you wanne add
8. Repet 6,7 until you finish all people
9. Press 2 to Train a model
10. Press 3 and enjoy
