# Problem
recoginze each person in front of a camera by making the computer identitfy this person through taking some images for him
to use it in any other application such as face identification , submit attendance and security elements like identifying people entering some place

# Solution
1- Get a computer with attached camera ready (**Recommended** : *high quality camera*)
2- Using OpenCV liberary create a dataset for the person required to be known
3- Repet step 2 until we get all required persons
4- Train a model using LBPH Face Recognizer in OpenCV face module
5- Open the camera again in the identification state to identify anyone in front of it
